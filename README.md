# DSA in Dart

This repository contains solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions implemented in Dart. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts using the Dart programming language.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the repository includes the following algorithms and problems:

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search** - Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort** - Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort** - Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Selection Sort** - Finds the smallest element and swaps it with the first element, repeating the process.

### 📝 String and Array Problems
- **Check Palindrome** - Determines if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Count Occurrences** - Counts the occurrences of a specific element in a list.
- **Count Vowels & Consonants** - Calculates the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
- **Reverse String** - Reverses the given string.
- **First Duplicate** - Finds the first duplicate element in a list.
- **Second Duplicate** - Finds the second duplicate element in a list.
- **First Non-Repeating Character** - Identifies the first character in a string that does not repeat.

### 🔢 Number Series
- **Fibonacci Sequence** - Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sivaprasadnk/DSA.git
   ```

2. Run a Dart file to test a specific algorithm:
   ```sh
   dart run path/to/file.dart
   ```
